I'm a software engineer and a Master's student at Concordia University, Montr√©al, and I love digging into complex systems to make them better. My journey in tech has given me the chance to work on some fascinating challenges, from working on recommendation engine, and optimizing site reponse times at Amazon to hunting down elusive bugs in Shopify's checkout ecosystem.

Right now, I'm focused on finishing my Master's degree and applying what I learn in my internship at Shopify.

## Where I've Contributed üè¢

<span style="color:#96BF48; font-weight: bold">**Software Engineering Intern** @ **Shopify** (Montr√©al, QC).</span>

My main focus was on data integrity and system reliability.

- I worked to ensure merchants could trust their Sales Data by resolving critical data discrepancies in checkout analytics.
- I refactored the abandoned checkout recovery GraphQL queries to improve reliability and data accuracy across shops.
- To help the team move faster, I implemented targeted logging to speed up the debugging of revenue-impacting calculation errors.

<span style="color:#FF9900; font-weight: bold">**Software Development Engineer** @ **Amazon** (Bangalore, KA)</span>

At Amazon, I had the opportunity to work on large-scale systems and improve user experience.

- I worked on a recommendation system that led to a 28% boost in activity and improved seller search on the app.
- I worked on optimizing system latency for UMT Vendor Site, cutting it down from 12 seconds to 2 seconds.
- I also earned team recognition for refactoring legacy code and quickly fixing critical issues.

## Teaching Assistantship Experience

<span style="color:#912338; font-weight: bold">**Teaching Assistant** @ **Concordia University**</span>

As a Teaching Assistant for both graduate and undergraduate courses, I've had the opportunity to mentor students in advanced programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

- **Course Instruction:** Led weekly labs and tutorials for 60+ students, strengthening their grasp of object-oriented programming and advanced Java design patterns. Courses include:
  - **COMP 6481: Programming and Problem Solving** <span style="color:red">(Graduate Level)</span>
  - **COMP 249: Object Oriented Programming II** <span style="color:red">(Undergraduate Level)</span>
- **Student Evaluation:** Reviewed and provided detailed feedback on over 200 student projects and assignments, covering topics like advanced Java GUIs, collections, and algorithms.
- **Mentorship:** Assisted students individually with debugging and mastering complex programming concepts during office hours.

## Some Things I've Built üöÄ

**Venue Classification using ML & DL**

- This was a deep dive into machine learning where I developed a scene classification model using hyperparameter tuning.
- By implementing a custom CNN with an AdamW optimizer, I was able to achieve 94% classification accuracy, beating the baseline models by 12%.
- **Tech Used**: Python, PyTorch, Jupiter, Tensorflow

**StackGAN Implementation**

- A project where I trained a model to generate images from text descriptions using the CUB-200-2011 birds dataset.
- I modernized the original author's outdated code to align with current versioning standards.
- The result was high-quality image generation at both 64x64px and 256x256px resolutions.
- **Tech Used**: Tensorflow, Keras, Python
