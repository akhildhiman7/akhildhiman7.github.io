Hi, I’m Akhil, a Master's student in Computer Science at Concordia University in Montréal, Quebec. My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Systems, and Advanced Algorithms—areas that keep me curious and motivated.

My journey began with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar, India, which built my foundations and interest in engineering.

I started my software engineering career at Amazon—first as an intern in the DCCS organization, then as a Software Development Engineer in the SFT organization. I worked on projects that impacted customers globally and learned how to turn ideas into real, reliable systems.

Outside of tech, I enjoy photography. It keeps me grounded in creativity and helps me see things from new angles.
