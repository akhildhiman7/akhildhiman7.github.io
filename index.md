## About

Hi, I’m Akhil, a Master's student in Computer Science at Concordia University in Montréal, Quebec. My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Systems, and Advanced Algorithms.

I began with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar, India.

I worked at Amazon—first as an intern in DCCS, then as an SDE in SFT—on projects that impacted customers globally.
